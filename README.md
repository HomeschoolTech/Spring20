# Spring20

Reminder, always pull before you push

you should be able to just use 
```git push```
and
``` git pull```

Use `git add -i` to pick and choose what to add to be commited. 
Use `git add -A` to add all modified files to be commited

Commit regularly and add meaningful commit messages.
```git commit -m"mycommitmessage"```

Use 
```git config --global core.editor "vim"```
To associate vim as the git editor

Don't worry about branches or forks; we won't be using them this semester.
